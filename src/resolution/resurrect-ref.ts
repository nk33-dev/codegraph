 * `createEdges` writes into edge metadata. Inserted as status='pending', the
 * ref is consumed by the same sync's resolution sweep: it rebinds to an
 * alternative definition if one exists, or parks as status='failed' where the
 * #1240 retry finds it if the symbol later reappears.
 *
 * Returns null — drop silently, the pre-#1240 behavior — for edges without a
 * refName stamp (created before the stamp existed, or synthesized): rebuilding
 * a ref from the target's plain node name would strip the receiver/qualifier
 * context the original text carried (`h.greet` → `greet`) and could rebind
 * somewhere a full re-index never would. Silent beats wrong.
