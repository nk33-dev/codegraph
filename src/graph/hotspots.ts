/**
 * Risk hotspots: the functions a reader should open first.
 *
 * Complexity is the one signal the graph did not already have — call counts,
 * fan-in, changed symbols and related tests all exist elsewhere. It is computed
 * HERE, at read time, from the file's own bytes with the tree-sitter grammars
 * already on disk, and never persisted: the AST is discarded after extraction
 * (no node carries a construct count, and the kernel's reserved per-node metrics
 * slot is unpopulated), so a stored metric would mean an extraction change, a
 * kernel ABI bump and a schema migration. A report over a bounded candidate set
 * does not need any of that.
 *
 * The score is a lead, not a verdict. Complexity counts are a coarse proxy —
 * TypeScript counts a plain `&&` as a decision, and the node-type tables below
 * are grammar-version-sensitive. Every language is pinned by a fixture test with
 * a known decision count; that test, not this comment, is what says the names
 * are right.
