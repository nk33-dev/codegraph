# Phase 1: structured graph queries

This phase extends the existing graph queries: it does not start LSP, does not add a separate MCP service, and does not change the default source and call-chain output. Definitions and references come from the Tree-sitter/graph index and must not be treated as the complete semantic result of a language server.

## Usage entry point

Keep using `codegraph_explore`, selecting structured queries through `mode`:

| mode | query | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `explore` (default) | Question or symbol name | The original source and call-chain text |
| `definitions` | Symbol name or qualified name | Positions of matching definitions; definitions sharing a name are not merged on our own |
| `references` | Symbol name or qualified name | Reference relations in the graph, each item stating source, target, relation type and provenance |
| `symbols` | Exact project-relative file path | File symbol overview, including parent symbol IDs |
| `status` | `status` | Index time, watcher state, pending files and unfinished reference resolution |

Structured modes accept `offset` (0-based, default 0) and `limit` (1–200, default 50); `file` is an exact file qualifier and does not do fuzzy suffix matching. In `symbols`, file can override the path given by query. `projectPath` reuses the existing cross-project resolution and path validation.

```json
{"mode":"definitions","query":"CodeGraph.queryCode","file":"src/index.ts","limit":20}
```

The CLI is used through explore as well, and structured modes output JSON directly:

```sh
codegraph explore CodeGraph.queryCode --mode definitions --file src/index.ts
codegraph explore queryCode --mode references --limit 20
codegraph explore src/index.ts --mode symbols
codegraph explore status --mode status --check-files
```

Development verification must invoke the local `node dist/bin/codegraph.js`; a globally installed old version must not stand in for the current implementation. Library users get the same results through `CodeGraph.queryCode(request)`.

## Return contract

- `schemaVersion: 1`, `backend: "graph"`, `mode`, `query` and `projectRoot` identify the query source.
- `status` distinguishes `ok`, `not_found`, `not_indexed` and `error`. A definition not found and a definition with no references are different states; an empty page does not mean the symbol does not exist.
- `items` returns symbols or references; `page` contains offset, limit, total and nextOffset. `ambiguous` means the target has multiple definitions, and does not disappear just because pagination shows only one item.
- Positions use index rows and columns: lines start at 1 and Tree-sitter byte columns start at 0; these are not LSP UTF-16 coordinates. IDs are identifiers in the current index, and must not be assumed to stay stable after moving a file or changing line numbers; query again by name and path.
- References are graph relations rather than every textual occurrence; they may be incomplete or inferred. When there are no call-site coordinates, site stays null, and a function definition position is not used to fake a call site.
- Every symbol states `freshness`: current, changed, missing or unavailable. The check reuses the index's size/mtime fast check and compares content hashes when necessary; it is not one atomic disk snapshot. A missing watcher does not mean the data must be stale.
- `index.changes: null` means there was no full working-tree scan. The existing change detection is only invoked when status explicitly passes `checkFiles: true`, and it does not trigger sync. pendingFiles and each category of changes list at most 100 paths; the real counts are in pendingFileCount and changeCounts.
- Results go both into MCP `structuredContent` and into the complete JSON in text; no text banner is concatenated outside the JSON. Not indexed is a handleable state, while invalid arguments or permission errors still return a tool error; generic MCP request validation keeps its original error format.

## Code ownership and upstream sync

| Entry point | Responsibility and reuse points |
| --- | --- |
| `CodeGraph.queryCode` in `src/index.ts` | Public library entry point; no separate parser/database is built |
| `src/graph/code-query.ts` | Unified contract and pagination for definitions, references, overview and status; reuses symbol-lookup and the existing graph queries |
| `src/sync/file-freshness.ts` | On-disk freshness check for a given file; reuses the existing hash format |
| `handleCodeQuery` in `src/mcp/tools.ts` | Existing explore mode dispatch, keeping path checks and working-tree hints; the main connection reads watcher state |
| explore in `src/bin/codegraph.ts` | CLI argument mapping and invocation of the same MCP handler |
| `src/mcp/server-instructions.ts` | The single source for tool usage documentation |

The hash decision previously inside `ToolHandler.isFileStaleOnDisk` moved into indexedFileFreshness; the old text mode still keeps its short-lived cache and original error handling. When upstream changes the old location, migrate it into the shared function; two different freshness algorithms must not come back.

Incremental indexing remains the responsibility of the existing sync/orchestrator/watcher. This phase adds change status and query regressions; it does not rewrite the incremental algorithm, and it must not be claimed to add the incremental indexing capability that upstream already had. Large-scale references queries still have to enumerate the matching graph edges: pagination limits the number of returned items, not the database scan to a single page.

## Verification

`__tests__/code-query.test.ts` uses real TS, JS and Rust files plus SQLite, covering definition ambiguity, exact file qualification, hierarchy, graph references, cross-project, CLI/MCP consistency, real MCP handshake, watcher state, file modification/rename/deletion, and consistency of incremental and rebuild results after a Git branch switch.

The shared freshness function also runs the original mcp-stale-slice and mcp-staleness-banner regressions. Complete build and full test results are recorded in the task handover/commit description; baseline failures of other tests must not be recorded as everything passing.
