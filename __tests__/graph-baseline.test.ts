/**
 * End-to-end graph baseline: index a checked-in fixture and compare the resulting graph against a
 * committed golden file.
 *
 * What this catches that nothing else does. The kernel↔wasm parity suite compares two live
 * extractors to each other, so it stays green when both drop the same edge; the parser and
 * resolver unit tests assert on snippets, not on what actually landed in the database. After an
 * upstream sync or a parser upgrade, the question "which relationships did we lose, and which
 * wrong ones appeared" had no answer that did not involve reading a diff by hand.
 *
 * The fixture is deliberately small and deliberately adversarial: two same-named methods that a
 * bare name match would confuse, a callback reachable only through a parameter, and a file whose
 * every line looks like a call site and is not one.
 *
 * Line numbers are part of the snapshot. Editing the fixture without regenerating the golden is a
 * failure, and that is intended: a moved symbol is exactly the kind of change worth seeing.
 *
 * Regenerate with (this file only — not a full test run):
 *
 *   CODEGRAPH_UPDATE_GRAPH_GOLDEN=1 npx vitest run --project engine __tests__/graph-baseline.test.ts
 *
 * then read the diff before committing it. A regeneration that grows the file is a review
 * question, not a chore.
